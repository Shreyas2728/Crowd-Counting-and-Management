# Crowd-Counting-and-Management
 Use object detection to count people in crowds.
Crowd counting and management using object detection is a vital application of AI and computer vision, enabling authorities and event organizers to ensure safety, optimize planning, and support epidemiological tracing in real time.

Count the total number of people in a scene.
Track movement and monitor crowd density over time.
Visualize data as heatmaps to identify high-density regions and potential risks.

**Practical Use Cases**
Public Safety and Security: Detecting overcrowding in transportation hubs, stadiums, and festivals with instant alerts to authorities for proactive management.​
Event Planning: Monitoring attendee distribution helps organizers open or close entry points and optimize crowd flow during events.​
Epidemiology: Tracking crowd sizes and densities aids in contact tracing and assessment of social distancing compliance during disease outbreaks.​
Urban Planning: Crowd analysis data guides city planners in designing safer and more efficient public spaces

**Typical Workflow**
Data Collection: Video streams or still images of crowds are captured from cameras positioned at event venues, public spaces, or transport hubs.​
Detection and Counting: Deep learning models process each frame to detect people and count them automatically. Advanced algorithms can even handle overlapping subjects by using techniques like head detection or density estimation where standard bounding boxes fail.​
Analysis and Management: Real-time dashboards display crowd counts, density distribution, and track movement patterns. The system can generate alerts if unsafe densities are reached, preventing stampedes or helping control viral outbreaks.​
Post-Event Insights: Data is analyzed for patterns, enabling better planning for crowd control, resource allocation, and infrastructure improvements for future events.
